Towards an instrumentalization of Risset beats

For now we have: a fundamental f0 + 4 partials f1, f2, f3, f4 each with a beating frequency (in Hz - beats per second). We also control the volume (yellow sliders) of each tone that generates each beating, decreasing the amplitude of the beating. Note that lower beating frequencies make the beating more perceivable as a pitch oscillation instead of a n amplitude oscillation.

Other types of Risset beats objects would be very welcome - more f1|beat pairs or more beating frequency per partial, for example.
